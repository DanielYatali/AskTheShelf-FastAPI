I figure if she gets good at this, it won't be difficult to train her AWAY from the styles that peddle backwards for brakes. Well, it worked fantastic! She never fell once and only hit the wrong brake ONCE. I simply detuned the front brake 30-40% less effective and that bike still stops on a dime!It is a very well made bike, very sturdy, and was a snap to put together. I'm also very happy about the derailed guard. It has some significant wear in 3 months, but derailed looks like new.I would urge any mom/dad to buy this bike. I would, however, suggest they get some flashing LED lights and put them on. The kid will love them and you get some peace of mind your are making poopkins way easier to see!",

Assembly was pretty straight forward and took less than an hour. The only thing I would say is shifting back down is a little tough, but he is still able to do it and doesn’t seem to be an issue for him. We haven’t used it enough yet to comment on wear, but the price was right and so far we are very satisfied with this bike. Don’t hesitate to buy sooner than later, it seems bicycles are already selling out quickly with spring weather being just around the corner. I would definitely recommend this purchase!",
